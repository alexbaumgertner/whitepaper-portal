# Stub to start a new BEM project

### Build the project

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/enb make
```
or
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

To be able to run commands without typing a full path to an executable file (`./node_modules/.bin/enb`), use:

```bash
export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

Now you can use `enb` or `gulp` from the root of your project.

```bash
enb make
```
